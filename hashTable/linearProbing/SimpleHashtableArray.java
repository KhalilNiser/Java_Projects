 * Data Structure: Employee linearProbing.array[] (linearProbing) 
 * Theory/Implementation
 * 
 * 				---- HASH_TABLES ----
 * The Hashtable class implements a hash table, which maps keys to values. 
 * Any non-null object can be used as a key or as a value. To successfully 
 * store and retrieve objects from a hashtable, the objects used as keys 
 * must implement the hashCode method and the equals method.  
 * 
 * The java.util.Hashtable class is a class in Java that provides a key-value 
 * data structure, similar to the Map interface. It was part of the original 
 * Java Collections framework and was introduced in Java 1.0.
 * 
 * However, the Hashtable class has since been considered obsolete and its use 
 * is generally discouraged. This is because it was designed prior to the 
 * introduction of the Collections framework and does not implement the Map 
 * interface, which makes it difficult to use in conjunction with other parts 
 * of the framework. In addition, the Hashtable class is synchronized, which 
 * can result in slower performance compared to other implementations of the 
 * Map interface.
 * 
 * In general, itâ€™s recommended to use the Map interface or one of its 
 * implementations (such as HashMap or ConcurrentHashMap) instead of the 
 * Hashtable class.
 * 
 * 1.	ABstract Data Type: It doesn't dictate how the data is stored
 * 2.	Provides access to data using keys: 
 * 3.	Key doesn't have to be an integer
 * 4.	Consists of Key/value pairs: Data types don't have to match
 * 5.	Optimized for retrieval( when you know the key )
 * 6.	Associative Array is one type of hash table
 * 
 * 				---- HASHING ----
 * 1.	Maps keys of any data type to an integer
 * 2.	Hash function maps keys to an integer
 * 3.	In Java, hash function is Object.hashCode()
 * 4.	Collision occurs when more than one value has the same hashed
 * value
 * 
 * 				---- LOAD_FACTOR ----
 * 1.	Tells as how full a hash table is: Suppose we're backing the hash 
 * table with an Array(). The load factor will tell us how full is the 
 * array. And that is achieved by dividing the (# of items / capacity).
 * Which is essentaily the (size / capacity)
 * 
 * 2.	Load factor = number of items/capacity = size/capacity
 * 
 * 3.	Load factor is used to decide when to resize the array backing 
 * the hash table.
 * 
 * 4.	Do Not want Load factor too low (lots of empty spaces)
 * 
 * 5.	Do Not want load factor too high (will increase the likelihood
 * of Collisions)
 * 
 * 6.	Can play a role in determining the time complexity for retrieval 
 * 
 * 				---- ADD_TO_A_HASHTABLE_BACKED_BY_AN_ARRAY()
 * 1.	Provide a key/value fair
 * 
 * 2.	Use a Hash function to hash the key to an integer value
 * 
 * 3.	Store the value at the hashed key value: This is the 
 * index into the array
 * 
 * 				---- RETRIEVE_A_VALUE_FROM_A_TABLE ----
 * 1.	Provide the key 
 * 
 * 2.	Use a Hash function to hash the key to an integer value
 * 
 * 3.	Retrieve the value stored at the hashed key value
 * 
 * 				---- ADD_"JANE_JONES"_WITH_THE_KEY_OF_JONES ----
 * 1.	Use a hash function to map "Jones", to an integer. Let's 
 * assume we get the value 4
 * 2.	Store "Jane Jones" at array[4]
 * 
 * 				---- RETRIVE_THE_EMPLOYEE_WITH_THE_KEY_OF_JONES ----
 * 1.	Provide the key "Jones"
 * 1.	Use the same hash function to map "Jones", to an integer. Let's 
 * assume we get the value 4
 * 2.	Retrieve the value at array[4] -> "Jane Jones"
 * 
 * 
 * 				---- COLLISION_HANDLING ----
 * 				---- LINEAR_PROBING ----
 * Hashing with linear probing. Another approach to implementing hashing 
 * is to store N key-value pairs in a hash table of size M > N, relying 
 * on empty entries in the table to help with with collision resolution. 
 * Such methods are called open-addressing hashing methods. The simplest 
 * open-addressing method is called linear probing: when there is a 
 * collision (when we hash to a table index that is already occupied with 
 * a key different from the search key), then we just check the next entry 
 * in the table (by incrementing the index). 
 * 
 * There are three possible outcomes:
 * 1.	key equal to search key: search hit
 * 2.	empty position (null key at indexed position): search miss
 * 3.	key not equal to search key: try next entry
 * 
 * 
 * 				---- OPEN_ADDRESSING ----
 * There are two possible strategies in handling "Collision" when 
 * programming "Hashtables". The first one is called "Open Addressing".
 * So with open addressing what we do is, if we try to put an employee
 * into the table and we find out that there is already an employee at
 * the slot where we want to put the new employee, then we look for 
 * another position in the array[].
 * 
 * 
 * 				---- LINEAR_PROBING ----
 * There are different ways that we can check for other positions. I'm 
 * going to use what's called "linear probing". With linear probing when 
 * we discover that a position for a hashedKey value is already occupied, 
 * we increment the hashed value by 1, then we check the resulting index. 
 * 
 * 
 * 				---- TIME_COMPLEXITY ----
 * It's called "Linear Probing" because each time we increment the index,
 * we are doing in a linear fashion, and every increment of the index is 
 * called a "probe". So if we have to increment the index once before we 
 * find an empty position then we have to use one probe. If we have to 
 * Increment the index three times before we find an empty position, then 
 * we have to use three probes. As you can see the lower the number of 
 * probes the better.
